Here are the answers to your most burning questions:<br/><br/>### Why is the language called Swift?<br/>The language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. <br/><br/>### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?<br/>Swift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you wont miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.<br/><br/>### How easy is Swift to learn?<br/>Swift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/">According to Apple</a>, Swift is the first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. Some have even <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186/" target="_blank">called Swift the new BASIC</a>.<br/><br/>### Is it fast?<br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">Apple boasts</a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.<br/><br/>### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?<br/>Objective-C has been Apples primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.<br/><br/>### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?<br/>Absolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.<br/><br/>### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?<br/>As mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show its age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.<br/><br/>### How Stable is Swift?<br/>As with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.<br/><br/>The thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17" target="_blank">failable initializers</a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655" target="_blank">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*</a>.<br/><br/>### What other languages is it similar to?<br/>Swift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though youll also probably recognize some C syntax. <br/><br/>### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?<br/>Swift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.,https://lh5.ggpht.com/6dnxW1q6Hip7w1eSqZgKYO2nbGAC9EZjDOHIoKnUu15EgFwTwVl6RLJpU24unfD3e3by9PsZcvWVRS1qrddb=s0#w=4680&h=968,Take the first step in becoming an iOS Developer by learning about Swift and writing your first app.,intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585,False,intermediate,[u'iOS'],months,In this course we will build an iPhone app that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader.<br/><br/>This course will introduce you to iOS app development in Swift, a new programming language from Apple, and serves as your launching point into the [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003).,2017-05-19 02:42:26.943000,1

You will learn how OAuth 2.0 makes implementing security easier for developers and users alike by allowing your users to sign in to your applications while keeping all of the security on well-known and trusted OAuth providers. Finally, you will see OAuth 2.0 in action as you make API requests using Google's OAuth 2.0 Playground.<br/><br/>### Lesson 2 - Creating a Google+ Sign-In<br/>Learn about the different types of security flows your application can implement. You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user's browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow.<br/><br/><br/>### Lesson 3 - Local Permission Systems<br/>Add python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider's API.<br/><br/>###Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook & Other Providers<br/>Learn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application. You will add Facebook Login as an alternative sign in option for your users and understand how to use OAuth provider documentation to add as many providers as you see fit for your application.,False,https://www.udacity.com/course/authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api,,False,[{u'bio': u'Lorenzo has had a passion for education since his first experience teaching computer science at a summer camp during college.

By using A/B tests to make decisions, you can base your decisions on actual data, rather than relying on intuition or HiPPO's - the highest paid person's opinion! Designing good A/B tests and drawing valid conclusions can be difficult. You can almost never measure exactly what you want to know (such as whether the users are "happier" on one version of the site), so you need to find good proxies. You need sanity checks to make sure your experimental set-up isn't flawed, and you need to use a variety of statistical techniques to make sure the results you're seeing aren't due to chance. This course will walk you through the entire process. At the end, you will be ready to help businesses small or large make crucial decisions that could significantly affect their future!,True,,{u'youtube_url': u''},A/B Testing,[],This course requires introductory knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics. If you haven't learned these topics, or need a refresher, they are covered in the Udacity courses <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud201" target="_blank">Inferential Statistics</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud827" target="_blank">Descriptive Statistics</a>.<br/><br/>Prior experience with A/B testing is not required, and neither is programming knowledge.,### Lesson 1: Overview of A/B Testing<br/>This lesson will cover what A/B testing is and what it can be used for. It will also cover an example A/B test from start to finish, including how to decide how long to run the experiment, how to construct a binomial confidence interval for the results, and how to decide whether the change is worth the launch cost.<br/><br/>### Lesson 2: Policy and Ethics for Experiments<br/>This lesson will cover how to make sure the participants of your experiments are adequately protected and what questions you should be asking regarding the ethicality of experiments. It will cover four main ethics principles to consider when designing experiments: the risk to the user, the potential benefits, what alternatives users have to participating in the experiment, and the sensitivity of the data being collected.<br/><br/>### Lesson 3: Choosing and Characterizing Metrics<br/>One of the most important and time-consuming pieces of designing an A/B test is choosing and validating metrics to use in evaluating your experiment. This lesson will cover techniques for brainstorming metrics, what to do when you can't measure what you want directly, and characteristics you should consider when validating your metrics.<br/><br/>### Lesson 4: Designing an Experiment<br/>This lesson will cover how to design an A/B test. This includes how to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group - different online definitions of a "user", and what effects different choices will have on your experiment. It will also cover when to  limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base, how to calculate how many events you will need in order to draw strong conclusions from your results, and how this translates into how long to run the experiment. Finally, the lesson will cover how various design decisions affect the size of your experiment, so you will know which decisions to revisit if you need results more quickly.<br/><br/>### Lesson 5: Analyzing Results<br/>This lesson will cover how to analyze the results of your experiments. Step one is always to run some sanity checks so that you can catch problems with your experiment set-up. Then, you will learn how to check conclusions with multiple methods, including a hypothesis test on the effect size and a binomial sign test, if you get results that surprise you. You will also learn how measuring multiple metrics for the same experiment can make analysis difficult, and some techniques for handling multiple metrics. Finally, you will learn about several analysis "gotchas", and what to do if you see them, including how Simpson's Paradox can affect A/B tests, and why even statistically significant results might disappear when you launch.<br/><br/>### Final Project: Design and Analyze an A/B Test<br/>Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run.

You will analyze existing data visualization and create new ones to learn about the field. At its core, data visualization is a form of communication. Learn how to be a great communicator and how to enable readers to walk away from your graphics with insight and understanding. This course also makes use of open web standards (HTML, CSS, and SVG) to create data visualizations.<br/><br/>### You can also learn how to...<br/><br/>- communicate clearly with the best visual representation of your data<br/>- tell stories, spark discussion, and create calls to actions for readers<br/>- design graphics like ones from the NYTimes and other media companies<br/>- how to use open web technologies to create an online portfolio of your work<br/>- use visualization libraries (<a href="http://dimplejs.org/" target="_blank">dimple.js</a> and <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>) to create graphics,False,,{u'youtube_url': u''},Data Visualization and D3.js,[],Regardless of your programming background, you can learn about data visualization and design principles in Lesson 1a and Lesson 2a without the following recommended background.<br/><br/>To succeed in this course, you should to be familiar with basic programming principles, including data types (strings, arrays, booleans, etc.), `if else` statements, and `for` loops. You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036" target="_blank">Programming Fundamentals with Python</a> courses are great places to get started.<br/><br/>Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud304" target="_blank">Intro to HTML and CSS</a> course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.<br/><br/>This course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.<br/><br/>So why should you learn d3.js?<br/><br/>Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.<br/><br/><br/>If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a `for` loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804" target="_blank">Javascript Basics</a> course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.,### Lesson 1a Visualization Fundamentals (2 hours)<br/>Learn about the elements of great data visualization. In this lesson, you will meet data visualization experts, learn about data visualization in the context of data science, and learn how to represent data values in visual form.<br/><br/>### Lesson 1b D3 Building Blocks (4 hours)<br/>Learn how to use the open standards of the web to create graphical elements. Youll learn how to select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements. Make use of all the Instructor Notes throughout this lesson if you have little to no experience with HTML and CSS.<br/><br/>### Mini-Project 1: RAW Visualization (2 hours)<br/>Create a data visualization using a software of your choice. We will provide recommendations for visualization software as well as data sets. We want you to get right into making data visualization so heres your first chance!<br/><br/>### Lesson 2a Design Principles (2 hours)<br/>Which chart type should I use for my data? Which colors should I avoid when making graphics? How do I know if my graphic is effective? Investigate these questions, and learn about the World Cup data set which will be use throughout the rest of the course.<br/><br/>### Lesson 2b Dimple.js (4 hours)<br/>Learn how to create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library. You will learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about D3.js. You will be able to produce great graphics with minimal code, and all of your graphics will come with interactivity without any extra effort on your part. Dimple, it's simple!<br/><br/>### Mini-Project 2: Take Two (2-5 hours)<br/>Find an existing data visualization, critique it for what it does well and what it doesnt do well, and finally, recreate the graphic using a software tool of your choice. We recommend using Dimple.js, which is covered in Lesson 2b, but we dont want you to feel constrained by the choice of tools. Use any tool that works for you.<br/><br/>### Special Note<br/>At this point in the course, you can start the final project. The remaining content of the course covers narrative structures, types of bias, and maps. All of the code  in Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 pertains to d3.js. If you'd like to learn d3.js and complete the final project using d3.js, then please continue. If you prefer to stop, you can complete the final project using dimple.js.<br/><br/>### Lesson 3 Narratives (5 hours)<br/>Learn how to incorporate different narrative structures into your visualizations and code along with Jonathan as you create a graphic for the World Cup data set. Youll learn about different types of bias in the data visualization process and learn how to add context to your data visualizations. By the end of this lesson, youll have a solid foundation in D3.js.<br/><br/>### Lesson 4 Animation and Interaction (5 hours)<br/>Static graphics are great, but interactive graphics can be even better. Learn how to leverage animation and interaction to bring more data insights to your audience. Code along with Jonathan once again as you learn how to create a bubble map for the World Cup data set.<br/><br/>### Final Project: Making an Effective Data Visualization (2 hours or more)<br/>You will create a data visualization that conveys a clear message about a data set. You will use dimple.js or d3.js and collect feedback along the way to arrive at a polished product.<br/>####<b>NOTE:</b> As a free student, you are welcome to complete the project to showcase your learning; however, only students enrolled in the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002" target="_blank">Data Analyst Nanodegree</a> are able to submit the final project for review and certificate.

If youre a machine learning beginner, youre in the right place.,Youll learn how to start with a question and/or a dataset, and use machine learning to turn them into insights. <br/><br/>###Lessons 1-4: Supervised Classification<br/><br/>**Naive Bayes:** We jump in headfirst, learning perhaps the worlds greatest algorithm for classifying text.<br/><br/>**Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** One of the top 10 algorithms in machine learning, and a must-try for many classification tasks.  What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.<br/><br/>**Decision Trees:** Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.<br/><br/>###Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions<br/>Behind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.<br/><br/>###Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers<br/>Regressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  Whats a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  Well tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.<br/><br/>###Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning<br/><br/>**K-Means Clustering:** The flagship algorithm when you dont have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.<br/><br/>###Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features<br/><br/>**Feature Creation:** Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.<br/><br/>**Feature Selection:** Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.<br/><br/>**Principal Component Analysis:** A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.<br/><br/>**Feature Scaling:** Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.<br/>Learning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.<br/><br/>###Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation<br/><br/>**Training/testing data split:** How do you know that what youre doing is working?  You dont, unless you validate.

Valuable lessons often come from experience, and its from this experience that Steve brings a fresh perspective to the classroom to show you how to approach building your web application in a way that assuages the potential challenges you may face. <br/>In this course, you will learn by doing. Once you dive into the course experience, you will work on awesome projects: <br/><br/>- Have you ever thought about what it takes to build a blog from the ground up? Over the course of six lessons, you will build a blog together with Steve that will be fully functional, online, for anybody to read by the end of the course. <br/><br/>- Have you ever wondered how a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> works? As a final project for this course, you will be able to take all of your newly gained knowledge and apply it to build a complete wiki. <br/><br/>This course concentrates on back-end development, but regardless if you are interested in front-end development, back-end development, or anywhere in between the stack, this course will teach you the fundamental knowledge you need break into the web development world. Are you ready to dive in?,False,Make a webpage that anyone can add to and edit.,{u'youtube_url': u'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z37fUbpJ3s'},Web Development,[],In order to take the full advantage of this course, we want you to be well prepared for it. This course assumes an intermediate proficiency programming with Python, as well as a solid knowledge on the following topics: <br/><br/>- Basic computer science concepts such as procedures, decision statements, and loops. <br/>- Basic data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and hash tables. <br/>- Object-oriented programming. <br/><br/>Please feel free to peek at the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036" target="_blank">Programming Foundations with Python</a> courses to make sure you are comfortable with these required concepts for the course.,###Lesson 1: How the Web Works (2.5 hours)<br/>In this first lesson, you will learn basic concepts regarding the internet, browsers, HTML, and how all those elements fit together. Youll start using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to format content for webpages. Then youll get to see the mechanics of how the web works: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) via GET and POST requests. In the first problem set, you will get a simple website up and running with the Google App Engine platform. <br/><br/>###Lesson 2: Forms and Input (4 hours)<br/>In this second lesson you will learn about forms, a very common way to obtain input from users. You will learn how to get and process user input from webpages using Google App Engine to get a live form up and running. By the end of this lesson, you will know how to validate user input and securely obtain data from users.<br/><br/><br/>###Lesson 3: Databases (6 hours)<br/>You learned about getting all sorts of information from users in the previous lesson, but what do you do with it once its in your hands? You store it! In this third lesson, Steve will dive in and teach you what you need to know about databases, the final piece you need to start setting your blog in motion! You will learn about various database technologies, SQL, and the Google App Engine Datastore.<br/><br/>###Lesson 4: User Accounts and Security (6 hours)<br/>In this fourth lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of authentication and security, which are very relevant topics in almost any web application built today. Well start by examining how websites use cookies to authenticate users and how we can manage cookies from the backend of a web application. You will implement a login system for your blog and learn how to use hashing to securely read and transmit user passwords.<br/><br/>###Lesson 5: APIs (4.5 hours)<br/>Up until now, your programs have generated HTML that a browser can use to render a web page for the user. In the digital world, however, applications and websites communicate not only with people, but also with other applications and websites. By the end of this lesson, your blog will communicate with humans as well as with other computers. Your web application can generate data in formats such as XML and JSON that other computers can access through an API, or application programming interface. Those computers, in turn, can build websites or services that interact with your data. Youll first learn how to use APIs, and then build web applications as services so that other computers can glean data from your application. We will look at both XML and JSON by investigating how to read them, how to interpret them, and how to manipulate them. <br/><br/>###Lesson 6: Caching (3.5 hours)<br/>In this lesson, we will explore how to prepare your applications to run at a large scale. So far, we've written 'toy' applications for just one or two users. If we want to start writing apps for thousands or, perhaps, even millions of users, then obviously we'll need to think about scaling. When we talk about scaling, this may mean running your application on multiple machines, storing huge amounts of data, or consuming large amounts of bandwidth. In particular, we will learn about caching, including the uses of caching, why you might want to cache, and specific caching implementations such as Memcached. <br/><br/>###Lesson 7: Scaling Up (2.5 hours)<br/>In this last lesson of the course, Steve has prepared a relaxing, story-time segment.

Whether its age, vision concerns, limited hearing, a broken arm, or other limitations, everybody deserves access to their apps. This course dives into the why and how of making web applications accessible. As a bonus, accessible sites also tend to be more usable for everybody!,False,,{u'youtube_url': u''},Web Accessibility,[],Students should know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.,## Lesson 1: Overview<br/>In this lesson youll learn why accessibility matters, and who it affects. Youll also get a first look at the web accessibility guidelines (WAI  Web Accessibility Initiative), understand what POUR means for accessibility, and locate checklists to help make your own sites accessible.<br/><br/>## Lesson 2: Focus<br/>In this lesson youll learn how to make a page usable for anyone navigating with the keyboard. This starts with an introduction to the concept of focus (the element on the page to which keyboard events will be targeted), how to make elements focusable and when, and the order in which focusable elements will be traversed when exploring the page with the keyboard. Youll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. <br/><br/>## Lesson 3: Semantics Basics<br/>In this lesson youll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can't see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. Youll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. Youll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, youll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. <br/><br/>## Lesson 4: Semantics Extras<br/>In this lesson, youll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. Youll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! Youll also learn how to call out landmarks into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this semantic markup  also makes your markup more readable!)<br/><br/>## Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIA<br/>In this lesson, youll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and thats where ARIA comes in  Accessible Rich Internet Applications. Youll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. Youll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.<br/><br/>## Lesson 6: Style<br/>In this lesson, youll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your pages styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. Youll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.,True,https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api,,False,[{u'bio': u'Alice is a software engineer at Google who works on accessibility in Chrome.

What will you build?,False,Design and build your own mobile-friendly Salesforce app.,{u'youtube_url': u'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-OjiwuOTk'},Intro to Point & Click App Development,[],Good news! You don't need any programming experience and you don't need to know anything about Salesforce. You'll learn the ins and outs of point-and-click development, so all you need now is an interest in building an app.<br/><br/>One thing you should know: the skills you learn in this course are in high demand and will help further your career.,### Overview<br/>In this class youll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldnt use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).<br/><br/>There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But dont be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. <br/><br/>This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you'll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you'll put everything together.<br/><br/>### Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)<br/>What **is** Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?<br/><br/>In this lesson, youll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. <br/><br/>### Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)<br/>In this lesson youll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. Youll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, youll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, youll learn about:<br/><br/>* **Salesforce Data**: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. Youll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. <br/>* **Relationships**: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson youll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. <br/>* **Validation Rules**: If youve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, youll learn how to build them into your app. <br/>* **Formulas and Summaries**: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson youll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.  <br/><br/>### Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)<br/>Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson youll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which youll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: <br/><br/>* **One-to-Many Relationships**: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson youll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. <br/>* **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Youll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. <br/>* **Customizing the User Interface**: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson youll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.<br/>* **Schema Builder**: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson youll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.<br/>* **Data Loading**: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.<br/><br/>### Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins) <br/>No matter what kind of app youre building, youve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson youll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, youll learn how to make:<br/><br/>* **Reports**: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. <br/>* **Charts**: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.<br/>* **Dashboards**: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.<br/>* **Views**: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.<br/><br/>### Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)<br/>In this lesson youll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. Youll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: <br/><br/>* **Workflows**: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.<br/>* **Approval Processes**: You dont want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say this looks good. Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.<br/><br/>### Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)<br/>This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse youll make your app social and mobile. The tools youll use are:<br/><br/>* **Chatter**: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.  <br/>* **Salesforce1**: That web app youve been building this whole time? Its actually a mobile app too. Youll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. <br/><br/>### Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)<br/>By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now its time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.,False,https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-point-click-app-development--ud162?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api,Create Your Own Salesforce App,True,[{u'bio': u'Samantha Ready is a Developer Evangelist at salesforce.com.

And no wonder - it provides an easy and affordable way to run your applications. However, the traditional way of hosting and scaling applications on Virtual Machines in the Cloud comes with a cost - even if the infrastructure is virtual, you still have to manage it - do load balancing, bring instances up and down, take care of patching your software and in general spend a lot of your time and resources on just the infrastructure. <br/><br/>Google is one of the pioneers in the business of scaling, and now you can use their infrastructure, and let them do all the scaling work so that you can focus on the unique features your app provides.<br/><br/>Are you a Python developer?

This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.<br/><br/>This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. Scale really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way youve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques youll need to do so.<br/><br/>The techniques youll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques youll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice.
